> Hi,
At [1] you can find a version of the script provided by Simone to fetch the DCS database. 
The exact name of the db and the password are taken from env variables. 
The details of password and username can be provided by Simone in cc. 
If the psw canâ€™t be shared, we might think to get a compiled version of the code, having the psw hard coded.

Q1: Can we share the P.W. with Seungjin?
Q2: What will Simone take his vacation? How long?
Q3: Will you could have efficiencies some time in this week?
Also: how much data (luminosity) for efficiency will be requited?
In Run2 slice test, with 200 nb-1, we had ~ 4500 muons (pT > 20) per chamber.
Approximately 200 per VFAT.  This is a good amount.
